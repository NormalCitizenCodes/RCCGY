                    <p>
                        In the quiet streets of <strong>Puntod, Cagayan de Oro</strong>, a small group of strangers found a common rhythm. What began as a humble effort to stay active evolved into the grit of finishing the next kilometer together. We didn't just start a club; we sparked a change.
